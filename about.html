    <h1>About Html</h1>
    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language 
    <br>used to create and design web pages. <br>
    It provides a structured means to define the content <br>
    and layout of a webpage, <br>
    allowing web browsers to interpret. <br>
     and display this content to users.

Basic Structure and Syntax
HTML documents are composed of elements represented by tags <br>
enclosed in angle brackets ( >).<br>
 These tags define the structure and content of the webpage.<br>
  Tags typically come in pairs: an opening tag (tag>) <br>
 and a closing tag (/tag>), with content nested between them. <br>
 For example, a paragraph is defined using p> for <br>
 <br>
 opening and /p> for closing.

Elements and Attributes
Elements are the building blocks of HTML pages, representing different<br>
 types of content such as headings (h1> to h6>), <br>
paragraphs (p>), images (img>), links (a>), lists (ul>, ol>, li>),<br>
 forms (form>, input>, button>), and more. <br>
Elements can have attributes that provide additional information about them.<br>
 For example, the a> (anchor) tag <br>
 uses the href attribute to specify the URL of the link.

Semantic HTML
HTML5 introduced semantic elements that provide meaning to the <br>
content they wrap, making it easier for developers <br>
to structure a page more accurately <br>
and for search engines and <br>
assistive technologies to interpret content correctly. <br>
 Examples include article>, section>, header>,<br>
  footer>, nav>, aside>, and main>.

Document Structure
An HTML document starts with a !DOCTYPE html> declaration, <br>
indicating the version of HTML being used (HTML5 in this case). <br>
The document structure typically includes:

html>: Encloses the entire content of the page.
head>: Contains meta-information about the document, <br>
such as title>, meta>, link>, and style> tags.
body>: Contains the visible content of the document, <br>
including headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, etc.
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript
While HTML defines the structure of a webpage, <br>
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control its presentation,<br>
 including layout, colors, fonts, and more. JavaScript,<br>
 on the other hand, adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.

Accessibility Features
HTML supports accessibility features through attributes like alt <br>
for images (img>), aria-* attributes for defining roles<br>
 and states, and semantic HTML elements that
 <br> improve the accessibility of web content.<br>
  These features are crucial for <br>
  ensuring that web content is accessible to users with disabilities.

Evolution of HTML
HTML has evolved over time, with HTML5 being <br>
the latest major version (as of the time of writing). <br>
HTML5 introduced <br>
new features such as new semantic elements,<br>
 multimedia elements (audio> and video>), <br>
form enhancements, and APIs for<br>
 enhanced web applications.
br
Browser Rendering
Web browsers interpret HTML documents and render<br>
 them visually based on the HTML structure and CSS styling. <br>
 Browsers handle different HTML elements and <br>
 attributes in standardized ways but <br>
 may have slight variations <br>
 in rendering and behavior.

Conclusion
HTML is foundational to web development,<br>
 providing the structure and content for web pages across the Internet.<br>
 Understanding HTML is essential for anyone <br>
 involved in web development, from creating basic static pages  <br>
 to developing complex web applications that <br>
 utilize HTML along with CSS and JavaScript.
